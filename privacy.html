    This webpage constitutes a map of the wold with pins of various
    locations with good, or hopefully good coffee. The locations are an
    amalgamation of the "cromulentcoffee" instram API app reading the
    @cromulentcoffee instagram account. There are further details
    sources from the cromulentcoffee.github.io account.
